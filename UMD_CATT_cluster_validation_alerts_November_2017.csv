CDH Version: CDH5.7.1

Cluster1 with 21 nodes
"Consistent Kerberos",CURIOSITY,"Kerberos is disabled, so the issue below probably irrelevant. Different hosts have different Kerberos configs. Saw 2 distinct configs on 21 hosts. Host datanode10.umd.edu has the most common config. Affected hosts list indicates those that don't match most common config.","datanode1.umd.edu,datanode13.umd.edu,datanode14.umd.edu,datanode15.umd.edu",,,
"Disk Error Validator",ERROR,"Potential disk errors detected in dmesg output for indicated hosts.","datanode4.umd.edu,datanode6.umd.edu,datanode8.umd.edu",,,
"DMESG process blocked",WARN,"The dmesg log indicates that task(s) were blocked on host(s). This might be normal if they were waiting for semaphores, but could mean e.g. IO contention due to failing disks, controllers or drivers. Check performance counters of the impacted hosts. Top hosts: webnode2.umd.edu (7); Top tasks: java (5), ntpd (1), vim (1) (note: the log entries might be old, and might not have anything to do with current problems)","webnode2.umd.edu",,,
"HBase Thrift Server - Frame and Compact options",WARN,"The HBase Thrift Server roles on this cluster are running in unsecure mode but have their 'Framed' (transport) and 'Compact' (protocol) options both disabled or only one of them enabled.  This can cause them to crash during situations where random or incorrect data is sent to its ports (due to a security software scan, or a bad client, etc.). To prevent these avoidable crash possibilities, it is highly recommended to enable both the Framed Transport and Compact Protocol options. Combining both options together yields the strongest protection against the bad messages crashing the HBase Thrift service.  Note: Changing these options may require code changes to any custom HBase Thrift Server client software, to adapt to the new transport (TFramedTransport) and protocol (TCompactProtocol) options when building the client connection.  Please refer to https://cloudera-portal.force.com/articles/KB_Article/HBase-thrift-server-crash for more information on how to configure these in Cloudera Manager, and to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11052 for more information on the cause behind the issue.",,"HBASE","HBASETHRIFTSERVER",
"Host Page Allocation Failure validation",WARN,"The dmesg log indicates that page allocation errors occured on the host(s). Worst Host is: datanode3.umd.edu  with a rate of 1.43 msgs/day.       The page allocation errors are likely happening due to higher network load where kernel cannot allocate a contiguous chunk of memory for a network interrupt.       This happens on 10GbE interfaces of various manufacturers.       Increasing the minimum amount of free memory that kernel needs to keep can prevent these errors. On a server-class machine,       I would suggest that you set this to at least 1GB (preferably 2GB):             vm.min_free_kbytes = 1048576             You can add this to /etc/sysctl.conf and reload it using 'sysctl -p'.             Note that you should also check whether there is an updated NIC firmware and drivers, as in some cases this is the only solution to page allocation errors.","datanode1.umd.edu,datanode10.umd.edu,datanode11.umd.edu,datanode2.umd.edu,datanode3.umd.edu,datanode7.umd.edu",,,
"JournalNode/ZooKeeper Disk Performance",ERROR,"Detected 750 JournalNode fsyncs lasting longer than 1 second in the previous two weeks, with the longest lasting 3.63 seconds (on mgrnode4.umd.edu at Thu Oct 19 19:39:28 2017).

"Low entropy",WARN,"The following hosts have less than 200 bits of entropy available. This may cause performance problems, since CDH uses system entropy to generate encryption keys and will be forced to wait for entropy if the pool is depleted. If you are seeing performance problems, you should check whether the entropy is chronically low, or this was a one-time problem.

"TSB validator",WARN,"TSB-2016-153:  A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudera Manager 5 releases prior to 5.7.2 can be used by an attacker to perform malicious actions. One probable form of attack is to steal the credentials from a victim's account. An upgrade to Cloudera Manager 5.7.2 or higher is required to resolve this.
